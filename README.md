# Meal Ideas

NOTE: Meal Ideas is currently a work in progress!

Meal Ideas is an app that intelligently plans your dinners for the next 7 days (or will be when it's done lol). The idea is that you tell it all the dinners you know, and then your worries of deciding what to eat are over. It will take things one step further, as you will not only tell you your plan for the next 7 days, it will be topped with ingredients and contextual decisions like roasts being best for Sundays. The idea is there will be some form of smart algorithm that makes the best decisions possible for you.

## Setting up the project

As I said, this is a WIP but if you wish to clone the project yourself then go ahead!

Setup is below:

-   Clone this repository with `git clone`
-   Install Docker with Docker Compose
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `docker-compose up`
-   Run `npm run seed` to generate and seed a new Postgres database
-   Run `npm run dev` to build and launch a dev server with the latest client and backend.
